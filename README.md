# RAG Document Application

An end-to-end RAG application (from scratch) based on FastAPI that processes PDFs, images, and web pages to obtain OCR data, generates embeddings using OpenAI's embedding models, and utilizes Pinecone as a vector database for search. It answers questions based on search results using OpenAI Chat Completion!

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 
- Docker
- Docker Compose (v2.20.2)
- AWS S3 Credentials (API-Keys)
- OpenAI API-Key
- Pinecone API-Key
- Prepare your .env file, learn in [Configuration](#configuration)


## Installation

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/teamunitlab/rag-document-app.git
 cd rag-document-app/
 docker-compose up -d --build
 ```


## Configuration
1. Fill a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```env
    API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
    PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_pinecone_index_name
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your_aws_region
    BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
    ```

2. Ensure AWS credentials and bucket policies are correctly configured to allow S3 access.

## Usage
1. Run the FastAPI application:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Recent Updates

### GitHub Pages Integration
- Deployed chat interface to GitHub Pages at `https://integraled.github.io/rag-bmore-app/`
- Configured CORS in Lambda URL settings to allow both:
  - Softr app domain (`https://bmore.softr.app`)
  - GitHub Pages domain (`https://integraled.github.io`)
- Simplified Lambda function by removing redundant CORS headers
- Moved index.html to root for proper GitHub Pages serving

### Lambda Configuration
- Function: `get-pinecone-config`
- Region: `us-east-2`
- Runtime: `nodejs22.x`
- CORS handling: Managed via Lambda URL configuration
